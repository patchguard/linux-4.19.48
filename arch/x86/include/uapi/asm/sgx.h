/**
 * __vdso_sgx_enter_enclave() - Enter an SGX enclave
 * @rdi:	Pass-through value for RDI

 *
 * NOTE: __vdso_sgx_enter_enclave() does not ensure full compliance with the
 * x86-64 ABI, e.g. doesn't explicitly clear EFLAGS.DF after EEXIT.  Except for
 * non-volatile general purpose registers, preserving/setting state in
 * accordance with the x86-64 ABI is the responsibility of the enclave and its
 * runtime, i.e. __vdso_sgx_enter_enclave() cannot be called from C code
 * without careful consideration by both the enclave and its runtime.
 *
 * All general purpose registers except RAX, RBX and RCX are passed as-is to
 * the enclave.  RAX, RBX and RCX are consumed by EENTER and ERESUME and are
 * loaded with @leaf, asynchronous exit pointer, and @tcs respectively.
 *
 * RBP and the stack are used to anchor __vdso_sgx_enter_enclave() to the
 * pre-enclave state, e.g. to retrieve @e and @handler after an enclave exit.
 * All other registers are available for use by the enclave and its runtime,
 * e.g. an enclave can push additional data onto the stack (and modify RSP) to
 * pass information to the optional exit handler (see below).
 *
 * Most exceptions reported on ENCLU, including those that occur within the
 * enclave, are fixed up and reported synchronously instead of being delivered
 * via a standard signal. Debug Exceptions (#DB) and Breakpoints (#BP) are
 * never fixed up and are always delivered via standard signals. On synchrously
 * reported exceptions, -EFAULT is returned and details about the exception are
 * recorded in @e, the optional sgx_enclave_exception struct.

 * If an exit handler is provided, the handler will be invoked on synchronous
 * exits from the enclave and for all synchronously reported exceptions. In
 * latter case, @e is filled prior to invoking the handler.
 *
 * The exit handler's return value is interpreted as follows:
 *  >0:		continue, restart __vdso_sgx_enter_enclave() with @ret as @leaf
 *   0:		success, return @ret to the caller
 *  <0:		error, return @ret to the caller
 *
 * The exit handler may transfer control, e.g. via longjmp() or C++ exception,
 * without returning to __vdso_sgx_enter_enclave().
 *
 * Return:
 *  0 on success,
 *  -EINVAL if ENCLU leaf is not allowed,
 *  -EFAULT if an exception occurs on ENCLU or within the enclave
 *  -errno for all other negative values returned by the userspace exit handler
